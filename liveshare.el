;;; Commentary:

;; Liveshare is a collaborative code editor that uses a decentralized model so that no centralized server is needed.
;; Thus, storage of the underlying document is entirely done by each client.
;; Internally, it uses a Conflict-free Replicated Data Type (CRDT), allowing messages to come in any order.

;; Full documentation is available as an Info manual.
